===========
Conventions
===========

Line length
===========

All Python code in this package should be PEP8 valid. However, we don't strictly
enforce the 80-char line length rule. It is encouraged to have your code
formatted in 80-char lines, but somewhere it's just more readable to break this
rule for a few characters. Long and descriptive test method names are a good
example of this.

.. note::
    Configuring your editor to display a line at 80th column helps a lot
    here and saves time.

.. note::
    The line length rules also applies to non-python source files, such as
    documentation .rst files.


Docstrings style
================

Read and follow http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/. That's it.


About imports
=============

1. Don't use * to import `everything` from a module.
2. Don't use commas to import multiple stuff on a single line.
3. Don't use relative paths.

.. sourcecode:: python

    from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    from zope.component import getSiteManager

instead of

.. sourcecode:: python

    from plone.app.testing import *
    from zope.component import getMultiAdapter, getSiteManager
    from .portal import get


Sort imports
============

As another imports stylistic guide: Imports of code from other modules should
always be alphabetically sorted with no empty lines between imports. The only
exception to this rule is to keep one empty line between a group of
``from x import y`` and a group of ``import y`` imports.

.. sourcecode:: python

    from App.config import getConfiguration
    from plone.app.testing import login

    import os

instead of

.. sourcecode:: python

    import os

    from plone.app.testing import login
    from App.config import getConfiguration


Commit checklist
================

Before every commit you should:

* Run unit tests and syntax validation checks.
* Add an entry to :ref:`changelog` (if applicable).
* Add/modify :ref:`sphinx-docs` (if applicable).

All syntax checks and all tests can be run with a single command. This
command also re-generates your documentation.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ make

.. note::
    It pays off to invest a little time to make your editor run `pep8` and
    `pyflakes` on a file every time you save that file. This saves you lots of
    time in the long run.


.. _changelog:

Changelog
=========

Feature-level changes to code are tracked inside ``docs/HISTORY.txt``. Examples:

- added feature X
- removed Y
- fixed bug Z

Add an entry every time you add/remove a feature, fix a bug, etc.


.. _sphinx-docs:

Sphinx Documentation
====================

Un-documented code is broken code.

For every feature you add to the codebase you should also add documentation
for it to ``docs/``.

After adding/modifying documentation, run ``make`` to re-generate your docs.

Also, documentation is automatically generated from these source files every
time code is pushed to `master` branch on GitHub. The post-commit hook is
handled by ReadTheDocs and the results (nice HTML pages) are visible at
http://ploneapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.


.. _travis:

Travis Continuous Integration
=============================

On every push to GitHub, `Travis <http://travis-ci.org/plone/plone.api>`_
runs all tests and syntax validation checks and reports build outcome to
``TODO: which?`` mailinglist and to the ``#sprint`` IRC channel.

Travis is configured with the ``.travis.yml`` file located in the root of this
package.


.. _git_workflow:

Git workflow & branching model
==============================

Our repository on GitHub has the following layout:

* **feature branches**: all development for new features must be done in
  dedicated branches, normaly one branch per feature,
* **master branch**: when features get completed they are merged into the master
  branch; bugfixes are commited directly on the master branch,
* **tags**: whenever we deploy code to production we tag the repository so we
  can later re-trace our steps and revert broken deployments if necessary.


.. _setting_up_git:

Setting up Git
==============

Git is a very useful tool, especially when you configure it to your needs. Here
are a couple of tips.

Enhanced git prompt
-------------------

Do one (or more) of the following:
 * http://clalance.blogspot.com/2011/10/git-bash-prompts-and-tab-completion.html
 * http://en.newinstance.it/2010/05/23/git-autocompletion-and-enhanced-bash-prompt/
 * http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/05/bash-auto-completion.html


Example of ``~/.gitconfig``
---------------------------

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [user]
        name = John Smith
        email = john.smith@gmail.com
    [diff "cfg"]
        funcname = ^\\(\\[.*\\].*\\)$
    [color]
        diff = auto
        status = auto
        branch = auto
    [alias]
        st = status
        ci = commit
        br = branch
        co = checkout
    [core]
        excludesfile = /home/jsmith/.gitignore
        editor = nano
    [github]
        user = jsmith
        token = <token_here>

Example of ``~/.gitignore``
---------------------------

.. sourcecode:: ini

.. _working-on-an-issue:

Working on an issue
===================

Out GitHub account contains a `list of open issues
<https://github.com/plone/plone.api/issues>`_. Click on one that catches your
attention. If the issue description says ``No one is assigned`` it means no-one
is already working on it and you can claim it as your own. Click on the button
next to the text and make yourself the one assigned for this issue.

Based on our :ref:`git_workflow` all new features must be developed in separate
git branches. So if you are not doing a very trivial fix, but rather adding new
features/enhancements, you should create a *feature branch*. This way your work
is kept in an isolated place where you can receive feedback on it, improve it,
etc. Once we are happy with your implementation, your branch gets merged into
*master* at which point everyone else starts using your code.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    [you@local plone.api]$ git checkout master  # go to master branch
    [you@local plone.api]$ git checkout -b issue_17  # create a feature branch
    # replace 17 with the issue number you are working on

    # change code here

    [you@local plone.api]$ git add -p && git commit  # commit my changes
    [you@local plone.api]$ git push origin issue_17  # push my branch to GitHub
    # at this point others can see your changes but they don't get effected by
    them; in other words, others can comment on your code without your code
    changing their development environments

Read more about Git branching at http://learn.github.com/p/branching.html. Also,
to make your git nicer, read the :ref:`setting_up_git` chapter.


Once you are done with your work and you would like us to merge your changes
into master, go to GitHub to do a *pull request*. Open a browser and point it to
``https://github.com/plone/plone.api/tree/issue_<ISSUE_NUMBER>``. There you
should see a ``Pull Request`` button. Click on it, write some text about what
you did and anything else you would like to tell the one who will review your
work, and finally click ``Send pull request``. Now wait that someone comes by
and merges your branch (don't do it yourself, even if you have permissions to do
so).

An example pull request text::

    Please merge my branch that resolves issue #13, where I added the
    get_navigation_root() method.
